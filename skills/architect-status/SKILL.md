# Architect Status

Report best-effort Architect state without changing it. Follow `references/status-protocol.md` as the source of truth.

## Hard Boundaries

- This skill is strictly read-only: never create, edit, move, delete, archive, or commit.
- Keep reads under safe `architect/` paths and never resolve malformed track links.
- Report integrity issues; do not repair them.

## Run

1. Read `references/status-protocol.md` and verify core context.
2. Classify missing, partial, or complete track-management state.
3. Parse safe registry entries, plans, and metadata best-effort.
4. Compute progress, current work, next action, blockers, and precedence-based project status.
5. Return the concise report and stop without mutations or interactive cleanup prompts.
